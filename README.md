## About

A portfolio covering my background, work experience, projects, education, and contact details. The main site is one self-contained page, `index.html`, plus a dedicated project page for DermaFusion, `dermafusion.html`. No framework, no build step, and no dependencies to install — the files are served directly by GitHub Pages.

## Stack

- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, inline in each page
- [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) and [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) via Google Fonts
- Images in `index.html` embedded as base64 data URIs; the DermaFusion app icon and screenshots (`dermafusion-icon.png`, `overview.jpg`, `learn.jpg`, `screen-*.jpg`) served from the repo root
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Features

- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive layout with a mobile nav drawer
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations via `IntersectionObserver`
- Tabbed project sections
- Dedicated DermaFusion project page with headline stats, an eight-screen app gallery, results and architecture tables
- 3D-tilt hero photo with a click-to-upload fallback
- Contact form and quick links (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, phone)

## Running locally

Clone the repo and open the file — that's it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulReddyKota/rahulreddykota.github.io.git
cd rahulreddykota.github.io
open index.html          # macOS; use `start` on Windows or `xdg-open` on Linux
```

To serve it over HTTP instead (closer to how Pages serves it):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploying

Any commit to `main` redeploys automatically through GitHub Pages, usually within a minute or two.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push
```

Hard-refresh (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R`) after deploying — browsers cache the HTML.

## Editing notes

- **Replacing the headshot:** the hero image is a base64 data URI on the `#heroPhoto` `<img>` tag. Encode a new JPEG with `base64 -w0 photo.jpg` and swap the string. A 3:4 crop around 693×924 keeps the file near 55 KB.
- **Updating the resume:** replace `Rahul_Reddy_Kota_Resume.pdf` at the repo root, keeping the filename so the hero and footer links keep working.
- **DermaFusion page:** the project card in `index.html` links to `dermafusion.html`. Its metrics come from the [DermaFusion-Skin-Cancer](https://github.com/RahulReddyKota/DermaFusion-Skin-Cancer) README, so update both pages if the results change. To add app screens, add images at the repo root and add an `<li><img></li>` to the `.screens` list. The app icon is `dermafusion-icon.png`.
- **Availability:** the "Open to Work" badge text lives in the `.hero-badge` div near the top of the hero section, and is echoed in the contact section blurb.

## Known limitations

- **The contact form does not send anything.** `handleContactSubmit()` only shows a "Message Sent ✓" confirmation and resets the fields — there is no backend. Anyone who uses it will believe they've reached me when they haven't. Wire it to [Formspree](https://formspree.io), [Getform](https://getform.io), or a similar service, or replace it with a plain `mailto:` link.
- Embedding images as base64 keeps the site dependency-free but inflates `index.html` to roughly 340 KB.
